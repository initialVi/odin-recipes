    <h2 class="headings">Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe uses wooden molds to create the delicate shapes of the cookies made from tapioca flour</p>
    <h3 class="headings">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bag (15 oz or 425 g) Tapioca Flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>A bunch of frozen or fresh pandan leaves, washed, pat dried, chopped into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 pandan leaves, tied each into a knot</li>
        <li>Cookie Mold</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="headings">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot, cook coconut milk, sugar, salt, and a couple knots of pandan leaves on low heat until the sugar melts, the leaves turn into yellowish color, and the coconut milk becomes condensed.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Discard the pandan leaves. Let it cool completely.  To make mint color cookies, add 1/8 teaspoon of pandan paste to the coconut mixture.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, toast flour and pieces of pandan leaves  on low heat until the leaves are completely dried and crispy. Make sure to stir the flour constantly to avoid it from being burn.</li>
        <li>Remove dried leaves and lumps of dried flour from flour using a strainer.</li>
        <li>Let it cool completely.</li>
        <li>Gradually add coconut milk to the flour.</li>
        <li>Using both of your hands to rub the flour.</li>
        <li>Add more of coconut milk and continue to rub it until a smooth flour is achieved. It should be powdery and  moist.</li>
        <li>Avoid adding too much of coconut milk to the flour at once. In my experience flour tends to clump together when there is a lot of liquid and when wet and dry are combined too quickly.  If the flour happens to be clump together, just add more toasted tapioca flour.</li>
        <li>When flour is smooth, powdery and moist, it's time to mold the cookies. Pour flour into the mold. Use your thumb to pack flour down tight.</li>
        <li>Use a flat knife to scrape off the excess of flour and also to smooth the surface.</li>
        <li>Flip the mold over and tap on the back or the sides of the mold to remove the cookies.</li>
    </ol>
